Results are live on https://amfeix-glassdoor.info/

WARNING: This is a collection of libraries written beforehand, with more modifications on top added hastily to cover current conditions. It is a work in progress, as you can probably see.

See config.example.*.js for external dependencies needed (Blockchain.com, Bitcoin full node with -txindex=1, Electrum full index server, and Ethereum full node / Infura), create config.js with filled setup.

You need a modern Node.JS

Install dependencies first with `npm install`

Index folders are used to keep cached state across multiple runs:

Execute with `npm run start`.

Point a webserver to `web/`
